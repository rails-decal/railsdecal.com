| Hi, I'm Juno. I'm a fourth year CS major (also thinking of a cog sci double). In my spare time I like to produce music, go hiking, play smash (melee), play guitar, watch reviews of cars I'll probably never be able to afford, and once in a while I paint. I think Rails is cool because it gives you all the tools you need to turn an idea into reality.
