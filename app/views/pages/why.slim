      h2 Are you qualified?
      .content
        p
          | We invite anyone from any major who has an interest in web development to
          |  take this class. We are asking that you have taken CS61A or an equivalent course.
          |  However, this is not a hard prerequisite. The only reason there is a prerequisite
          |  for CS61A is because we expect you to be able to run commands using the Terminal
          |  (something you learn throughout the class in CS61A). In addition, we're only
          |  planning on spending one lecture on basic Ruby syntax (because most of it is like
          |  Python and you can learn most of it as you go along). We are considering people who
          |  have not taken CS61A if they demonstrate that they have both of these characteristics.
          |  If you have any questions about whether or not you'll be ready for this course,
          '  please email us
          a href="mailto:railsdecal@gmail.com" here.
